so it is a bluetooth controlled car with basic functionalities of moving forward, backward, left, right depending upon user input. 
also a safety feature is implemented in it (i.e why the name safety car, lol) which when detects an obstacle 
under the range of 18cm from the car immediately overrides any user entered command and enters the car into reverse mode. 
the car keeps on reversing until it has moved the car to a distance of 18cm after which it stops the car. this feature is helpful to prevent accidents.
it can be scaled up by adding more sensors in other directions to improve safety coefficient. if you have any suggestion for my code do let me know. thanks
