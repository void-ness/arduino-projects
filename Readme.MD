this project. hmm this is a basic project demonstrating interfacing of python with arduino.
as per the input from user in python, arduino's inbuilt led switches on or off.
while trialtesting, a lot of times i had to upload code to my arduino. my open connection in python interrupted in the smooth upload of code to python
forcing me to terminate my python programm everytime i had to upload code to arduino. 
i found a solution to this problem by integrating an close / rerun mechanism in my code
which made it very easy to upload code without me having to terminate my code every single time.

thanks. hehe. bye
